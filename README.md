# Performing-EDA-and-prediction-Analysis-on-PIMA-dataset
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes,
based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database.
In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. 



In this note I perform Explotory data analysis :

1.Univariate Analysis

2.Bivariate Analysis

This is followed by data preprocessing 
where removing of outlier and skewness is done.

Feature   modelling is made ready for prediction Analysis.
My results is as follows:

KNeighborsClassifier 0.7 

LogisticRegression 0.7866666666666666 

RandomForestClassifier 0.7933333333333333 

AdaBoostClassifier 0.7733333333333333 

GradientBoostingClassifier 0.78
